Your task is to determine the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of days in a year on Mars.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n14\n\nOutput\n4 4\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n0 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample there are 14 days in a year on Mars, and therefore independently of the day a year starts with there will be exactly 4 days off .\n\nIn the second sample there are only 2 days in a year on Mars, and they can both be either work days or days off.",
    "Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.\n\nAn unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.\n\nAfter her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.\n\nNote that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.\n\nGiven the required information, find the maximum\u00a0number of chocolates Joty can get.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 \u2264 n, a, b, p, q \u2264 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer s \u2014 the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.\n\nNote that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it.

    "Now you can take online courses in the Berland State University! Polycarp needs to pass k main online courses of his specialty to get a diploma. In total n courses are availiable for the passage.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).\n\nHelp Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses).

    "A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than \"(\" and \")\". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence. For example, \"\", \"(())\" and \"()()\" are regular bracket sequences; \"))\" and \")((\" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and \"(a)\" and \"(1)+(1)\" are not bracket sequences at all.\n\nYou have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$.
